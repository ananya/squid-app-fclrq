Page 9,“Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating.” —John Cleese,17
Page 10,"When I have the privilege of talking to my readers,the most common questions they ask me are about self- promotion.How do I get my stuff out there? How do I get noticed? How do I find an audience? How did you do it? I hate talking about self-promotion.Comedian Steve Martin famously dodges these questions with the advice, “Be so good they can’t ignore you.”If you just focus on getting really good,Martin says,people will come to you. I happen to agree: You don’t really find an audience for your work; they find you.But it’s not enough to be good. 1",103
Page 11,"In order to be found,you have to be findable.I think there’s an easy way of putting your work out there and making it discoverable while you’re focused on getting really good at what you do. Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today,regardless of their profession,have built sharing into their routine.These people aren’t schmoozing at cocktail parties; they’re too busy for that.They’re cranking away in their studios,their laboratories,or their cubicles,but instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work,they’re open about what they’re working on,and they’re consistently posting bits and pieces of their work, their ideas,and what they’re learning online.Instead of wasting their time “networking,”they’re taking advantage of the network.By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge,they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it—for fellowship,feedback,or patronage. 2",144
Page 12,"I wanted to create a kind of beginner’s manual for this way of operating,so here’s what I came up with: a book for people who hate the very idea of self-promotion.An alternative,if you will,to self-promotion.I’m going to try to teach you how to think about your work as a never- ending process,how to share your process in a way that attracts people who might be interested in what you do,and how to deal with the ups and downs of putting yourself and your work out in the world.If Steal Like an Artist was a book about stealing influence from other people,this book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from you. Imagine if your next boss didn’t have to read your résumé because he already reads your blog.Imagine being a student and getting your first gig based on a school project you posted online.Imagine losing your job but having a social network of people familiar with your work and ready to help you find a new one.Imagine turning a side project or 3",180

Or imagine something simpler and just as satisfying: spending the majority of your time,energy,and attention practicing a craft,learning a trade,or running a business, while also allowing for the possibility that your work might attract a group of people who share your interests. All you have to do is show your work. 5",70

Page 18,"There are a lot of destructive myths about creativity,but one of the most dangerous is the “lone genius”myth: An individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere at certain points in history,free of influences or precedent, with a direct connection to God or The Muse.When inspiration comes,it strikes like a lightning bolt,a lightbulb switches on in his head,and then he spends the rest of his time toiling away in his studio,shaping this idea into a finished masterpiece that he releases into the world to great fanfare.If you believe in the lone genius myth,creativity is an antisocial act,performed by only a few great figures— mostly dead men with names like Mozart,Einstein,or Picasso.The rest of us are left to stand around and gawk in awe at their achievements. There’s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as “scenius.”Under this model,great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists,curators,thinkers,theorists,and other 9",161
Page 19,10,5
Page 20,"tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.”If you look back closely at history,many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other,looking at each other’s work,copying from each other,stealing ideas,and contributing ideas.”Scenius doesn’t take away from the achievements of those great individuals; it just acknowledges that good work isn’t created in a vacuum,and that creativity is always,in some sense,a collaboration,the result of a mind connected to other minds. What I love about the idea of scenius is that it makes room in the story of creativity for the rest of us: the people who don’t consider ourselves geniuses.Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are,but about what you have to contribute—the ideas you share,the quality of the connections you make,and the conversations you start.If we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, 11",170
Page 21,"we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us.We can stop asking what others can do for us,and start asking what we can do for others. We live in an age where it’s easier than ever to join a scenius.The Internet is basically a bunch of sceniuses connected together,divorced from physical geography. Blogs,social media sites,email groups,discussion boards, forums—they’re all the same thing: virtual scenes where people go to hang out and talk about the things they care about.There’s no bouncer,no gatekeeper,and no barrier to entering these scenes: You don’t have to be rich,you don’t have to be famous,and you don’t have to have a fancy résumé or a degree from an expensive school.Online, everyone—the artist and the curator,the master and the apprentice,the expert and the amateur—has the ability to contribute something. 12",144
Page 22,13,5
Page 23,“That’s all any of us are: amateurs. We don’t live long enough to be anything else.” —Charlie Chaplin 14,23
Page 24,"We’re all terrified of being revealed as amateurs,but in fact,today it is the amateur—the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French,the word means “lover”),regardless of the potential for fame,money,or career—who often has the advantage over the professional. Because they have little to lose,amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results.They take chances, experiment,and follow their whims.Sometimes,in the process of doing things in an unprofessional way,they make new discoveries. “In the beginner’s mind,there are many possibilities,”said Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki.“In the expert’s mind,there are few.” Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public.They’re in love,so they don’t hesitate to do work that others think of as silly or just plain stupid. “The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act,” writes Clay Shirky in his book Cognitive Surplus.“On the spectrum of creative work,the difference between the 15",152
Page 25,"mediocre and the good is vast.Mediocrity is,however,still on the spectrum; you can move from mediocre to good in increments.The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.”Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing. Amateurs might lack formal training,but they’re all lifelong learners,and they make a point of learning in the open,so that others can learn from their failures and successes.Writer David Foster Wallace said that he thought good nonfiction was a chance to “watch somebody reasonably bright but also reasonably average pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives.” Amateurs fit the same bill: They’re just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it. Sometimes,amateurs have more to teach us than experts.“It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can,”wrote 16",169
Page 26,17,5
Page 27,"author C.S.Lewis.“The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less.The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met.The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten.” Watching amateurs at work can also inspire us to attempt the work ourselves.“I saw the Sex Pistols,”said New Order frontman Bernard Sumner. “They were terrible....I wanted to get up and be terrible with them.”Raw enthusiasm is contagious. The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs.Even for professionals,the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown.When Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke was asked what he thought his greatest strength was,he answered,“That I don’t know what I’m doing.”Like one of his heroes,Tom Waits,whenever Yorke feels like his songwriting is getting too comfortable or stale,he’ll pick up an instrument he doesn’t know how to play and try to write with it.This is yet another trait of 18",167
Page 28,"amateurs—they’ll use whatever tools they can get their hands on to try to get their ideas into the world.“I’m an artist,man,”said John Lennon.“Give me a tuba,and I’ll get you something out of it.” The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn,and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.Find a scenius,pay attention to what others are sharing,and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing.Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts,no matter how bad they are at first.Don’t worry,for now,about how you’ll make money or a career off it.Forget about being an expert or a professional,and wear your amateurism (your heart,your love) on your sleeve.Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you. 19",148
Page 29,"“Find your voice, shout it from the rooftops, and keep doing it until the people that are looking for you find you.” — Dan Harmon 20",30
Page 30,"We’re always being told find your voice. When I was younger,I never really knew what this meant.I used to worry a lot about voice,wondering if I had my own.But now I realize that the only way to find your voice is to use it.It’s hardwired,built into you.Talk about the things you love.Your voice will follow. When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to treat his cancer,he lost the ability to speak.He lost his voice—physically and permanently.Here was a man who made a great deal of his living by speaking on television and now he couldn’t say a word.In order to communicate with his friends and family,he’d have to either scribble responses on a pad of paper,or type on his Mac and have the awkward computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers. Cut off from everyday conversation,he poured himself into tweeting,posting to Facebook,and blogging at rogerebert .com.He ripped out posts at a breakneck speed,writing 21",166
Page 31,22,5
Page 32,"thousands and thousands of words about everything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana,Illinois,his love for Steak’n Shake,his conversations with famous movie actors,his thoughts on his inevitable death.Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with the world.“On the web,my real voice finds expression,”he wrote. Ebert knew his time on this planet was short,and he wanted to share everything he could in the time he had left.“Mr. Ebert writes as if it were a matter of life and death,”wrote journalist Janet Maslin,“because it is.”Ebert was blogging because he had to blog—because it was a matter of being heard,or not being heard.A matter of existing or not existing. It sounds a little extreme,but in this day and age,if your work isn’t online,it doesn’t exist.We all have the opportunity to use our voices,to have our say,but so many of us are wasting it.If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about,you have to share. 23",177
Page 33,"“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs 24",86
Page 34,"If all this sounds scary or like a lot of work,consider this: One day you’ll be dead.Most of us prefer to ignore this most basic fact of life,but thinking about our inevitable end has a way of putting everything into perspective. We’ve all read stories of near-death experiences changing people’s lives.When George Lucas was a teenager,he almost died in a car accident.He decided “every day now is an extra day,”dedicated himself to film,and went on to direct Star Wars.Wayne Coyne,lead singer of The Flaming 25",89
Page 35,"Lips,was 16 when he was held up while working at a Long John Silver’s.“I realized I was going to die,”he says. “And when that gets into your mind ...it utterly changed me ...I thought,I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m going to make them happen,and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.” Tim Kreider,in his book We Learn Nothing,says that getting stabbed in the throat was the best thing to ever happen to him.For a whole year,he was happy and life was good.“You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a permanently life-altering experience,”Kreider writes, but “the illumination didn’t last.”Eventually,he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience,said,“For three or four days after that,it was the most beautiful world.To have gotten back in it,you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time,to really have that awareness that it’s actually going to end.That’s the trick.”  26",175
Page 36,"Unfortunately,I am a coward.As much as I would like the existential euphoria that comes with it,I don’t really want a near-death experience.I want to stay safe and stay away from death as much as I can.I certainly don’t want to taunt it or court it or invite it any closer than it needs to be.But I do somehow want to remember that it’s coming for me. It’s for this reason that I read the obituaries every morning. Obituaries are like near-death experiences for cowards. Reading them is a way for me to think about death while also keeping it at arm’s length. Obituaries aren’t really about death; they’re about life.“The sum of every obituary is how heroic people are,and how noble,”writes artist Maira Kalman.Reading about people who are dead now and did things with their lives makes me want to get up and do something decent with mine.Thinking about death every morning makes me want to live. 27",162

Page 38,"Try it: Start reading the obituaries every morning.Take inspiration from the people who muddled through life before you—they all started out as amateurs,and they got where they were going by making do with what they were given,and having the guts to put themselves out there. Follow their example. 29",53

Page 42,"When a painter talks about her “work,”she could be talking about two different things:There’s the artwork,the finished piece,framed and hung on a gallery wall,and there’s the art work,all the day-to-day stuff that goes on behind the scenes in her studio: looking for inspiration,getting an idea, applying oil to a canvas,etc.There’s “painting,”the noun, and there’s “painting,”the verb.As in all kinds of work, there is a distinction between the painter’s process,and the products of her process. Traditionally,the artist has been trained to regard her creative process as something that should be kept to herself. This way of thinking is articulated by David Bayles and 33",107
Page 43,34,5
Page 44,"Ted Orland in their book, Art and Fear:“To all viewers but yourself,what matters is the product: the finished artwork. To you,and you alone,what matters is the process: the experience of shaping the artwork.”An artist is supposed to toil in secrecy,keeping her ideas and her work under lock and key,waiting until she has a magnificent product to show for herself before she tries to connect with an audience.“The private details of artmaking are utterly uninteresting to audiences,”write Bayles and Orland, “because they’re almost never visible—or even knowable— from examining the finished work.” This all made sense in a pre-digital age,when the only way an artist could connect with an audience was through a gallery show or write-up in some fancy art magazine.But today,by taking advantage of the Internet and social media, an artist can share whatever she wants,whenever she wants, at almost no cost.She can decide exactly how much or how little of her work and herself she will share,and she 35",165
Page 45,"can be as open about her process as she wants to—she can share her sketches and works-in-progress,post pictures of her studio,or blog about her influences,inspiration,and tools.By sharing her day-to-day process—the thing she really cares about—she can form a unique bond with her audience. To many artists,particularly those who grew up in the pre-digital era,this kind of openness and the potential vulnerability that goes along with sharing one’s process is a terrifying idea.Here’s the author Edgar Allan Poe,writing in 1846:“Most writers—poets in especial—prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy— an ecstatic intuition—and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes.” But human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do.“People really do want to see how the sausage gets made.” That’s how designers Dan Provost and Tom Gerhardt put it in their book on 36",153
Page 46,37,5
Page 47,"entrepreneurship,It Will Be Exhilarating.“By putting things out there,consistently,you can form a relationship with your customers.It allows them to see the person behind the products.”Audiences not only want to stumble across great work,but they,too,long to be creative and part of the creative process.By letting go of our egos and sharing our process,we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work,which helps us move more of our product. “In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen— really seen.” —Brené Brown 38",96
Page 48,"In 2013,the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield,commander of the International Space Station. Three years earlier,Hadfield and his family were sitting around the dinner table,trying to figure out ways to generate interest for the Canadian Space Agency,which, like many space programs,faced major budget cuts and needed more public support.“Dad wanted a way to help people connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,”said Hadfield’s son Evan.“Not just the glamour and science,but also the day-to-day activities.” 39",85
Page 49,"Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work. Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him set up on Twitter and other social networks.During his next five-month mission,while performing all his regular astronautical duties,he tweeted, answered questions from his followers,posted pictures he’d taken of Earth,recorded music,and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails,brushing his teeth, sleeping,and even performing maintenance on the space station.Millions of people ate it all up,including my agent, Ted,who tweeted,“Wouldn’t normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair,but IT’S IN SPACE!”  Now,let’s face it: We’re not all artists or astronauts.A lot of us go about our work and feel like we have nothing to show for it at the end of the day.But whatever the nature of your work,there is an art to what you do,and there are people who would be interested in that art,if only you presented it 40",159
Page 50,"to them in the right way.In fact,sharing your process might actually be most valuable if the products of your work aren’t easily shared,if you’re still in the apprentice stage of your work,if you can’t just slap up a portfolio and call it a day,or if your process doesn’t necessarily lead to tangible finished products. How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? The first step is to scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting bit of media that you can share.You have to turn the invisible into something other people can see.“You have to make stuff,” said journalist David Carr when he was asked if he had any advice for students.“No one is going to give a damn about your résumé; they want to see what you have made with your own little fingers.” Become a documentarian of what you do.Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook,or speak them into an audio recorder.Keep a scrapbook. 41",177

Page 52,"Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process.Shoot video of you working.This isn’t about making art,it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you.Take advantage of all the cheap,easy tools at your disposal—these days,most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones. Whether you share it or not,documenting and recording your process as you go along has its own rewards: You’ll start to see the work you’re doing more clearly and feel like you’re making progress.And when you’re ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from. 43",107

Page 56,"Overnight success is a myth.Dig into almost every overnight success story and you’ll find about a decade’s worth of hard work and perseverance.Building a substantial body of work takes a long time—a lifetime,really—but thankfully,you don’t need that time all in one big chunk.So forget about decades,forget about years,and forget about months.Focus on days. The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around.Seasons change,weeks are completely human- made,but the day has a rhythm.The sun goes up; the sun goes down.I can handle that. 47",94
Page 57,"Once a day,after you’ve done your day’s work,go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share.Where you are in your process will determine what that piece is.If you’re in the very early stages,share your influences and what’s inspiring you.If you’re in the middle of executing a project,write about your methods or share works in progress.If you’ve just completed a project,show the final product,share scraps from the cutting-room floor,or write about what you learned.If you have lots of projects out into the world,you can report on how they’re doing—you can tell stories about how people are interacting with your work. A daily dispatch is even better than a résumé or a portfolio, because it shows what we’re working on right now.When the artist Ze Frank was interviewing job candidates,he complained,“When I ask them to show me work,they show me things from school,or from another job,but I’m more interested in what they did last weekend.”A good 48",167

The form of what you share doesn’t matter.Your daily dispatch can be anything you want—a blog post,an email, a tweet,a YouTube video,or some other little bit of media. There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for everybody. Social media sites are the perfect place to share daily updates.Don’t worry about being on every platform; pick and choose based on what you do and the people you’re trying to reach.Filmmakers hang out on YouTube or Vimeo.Businesspeople,for some strange reason,love LinkedIn.Writers love Twitter.Visual artists tend to like Tumblr,Instagram,or Facebook.The landscape is constantly changing,and new platforms are always popping up ...and disappearing. 51",131

A lot of social media is just about typing into boxes. What you type into the box often depends on the prompt. Facebook asks you to indulge yourself,with questions like “How are you feeling?”or “What’s on your mind?” Twitter’s is hardly better:“What’s happening?” I like the tagline at dribbble.com:“What are you working on?”Stick to that question and you’ll be good.Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work.

There’s a big,big difference between sharing and over- sharing. The act of sharing is one of generosity—you’re putting something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen. 57",148

Always be sure to run everything you share with others through The “So What?”Test.Don’t overthink it; just go with your gut.If you’re unsure about whether to share something,let it sit for 24 hours.Put it in a drawer and walk out the door.The next day,take it out and look at it with fresh eyes.Ask yourself,“Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?”There’s nothing wrong with saving things for later.The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment,but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning. 59",154

Page 71,"“Stock and flow”is an economic concept that writer Robin Sloan has adapted into a metaphor for media:“Flow is the feed.It’s the posts and the tweets.It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist.Stock is the durable stuff.It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today.It’s what people discover via search.It’s what spreads slowly but surely,building fans over time.”Sloan says the magic formula is to maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background. In my experience,your stock is best made by collecting, organizing,and expanding upon your flow.Social media sites function a lot like public notebooks—they’re places where we think out loud,let other people think back at us,then hopefully think some more.But the thing about keeping notebooks is that you have to revisit them in order to make the most out of them.You have to flip back through old ideas to see what you’ve been thinking.Once 62",165

We all love things that other people think are garbage. You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences,the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed “high”and the “low.” When you find things you genuinely enjoy,don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it.Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure you take in the things you enjoy.Celebrate them. 81",163

Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is,who made it,how they made it,when and where it was made,why you’re sharing it,why people should care about it,and where people can see some more work like it. Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share. Another form of attribution that we often neglect is where we found the work that we’re sharing.It’s always good practice to give a shout-out to the people who’ve helped you stumble onto good work and also leave a bread-crumb trail that people you’re sharing with can follow back to the sources of your inspiration.I’ve come across so many interesting people online by following “via”and “H/T” 85",166

Which one do you want to take home? Art forgery is a strange phenomenon.“You might think that the pleasure you get from a painting depends on its color and its shape and its pattern,”says psychology professor Paul Bloom.“And if that’s right,it shouldn’t matter whether it’s an original or a forgery.” But our brains 91",153

Most story structures can be traced back to myths and fairy tales.Emma Coats,a former storyboard artist at Pixar, outlined the basic structure of a fairy tale as a kind of Mad Lib that you can fill in with your own elements:“Once upon a time,there was _____.Every day,_____.One day, _____.Because of that,_____.Because of that,_____.

Of course,when you’re in the middle of a story,as most of us in life are,you don’t know if it’s a story at all,because you don’t know how far into it you are,and you don’t know how it’s going to end.Fortunately,there’s a way to tell open- 99",171

When I got to talk to Aaron and his wife,Stacy,during a break in filming,they explained that the technique of barbecue is actually very simple,but it takes years and years to master.There’s an intuition that you only gain through the repetition of practice.Aaron told me that he trains 114",175

The Franklins also just genuinely love barbecue,and they go out of their way to share their knowledge.People often stop by with their own attempts at brisket,and Aaron is always gracious and patient when answering their questions.You don’t get the feeling that any of this is calculated,it’s just the way they operate—they started out as beginners,and so they feel an obligation to pass on what they’ve learned.

It is actually true that life is all about “who you know.”But who you know is largely dependent on who you are and what you do,and the people you know can’t do anything for you if you’re not doing good work.“Connections don’t mean shit,”says record producer Steve Albini.“I’ve never had any connections that weren’t a natural outgrowth of doing things I was doing anyway.”Albini laments how many people waste time and energy trying to make connections instead of getting good at what they do,when “being good at things is the only thing that earns you clout or connections.” 131",163

Most people put up with this because they got to hang out with Picasso all day,but not Constantin Brancusi, the Romanian-born sculptor.Brancusi hailed from the Carpathian Mountains,and he knew a vampire when he saw one.He was not going to have his energy or the fruits of his energy juiced by Picasso,so he refused to have anything to do with him.

Roll with thepunches.

Buy me a coffee.”This is a very simple transaction, which is the equivalent of a band passing a hat during a gig—if people are digging what you do,they’ll throw a few bucks your way. If you have work you want to attempt that requires some up-front capital,platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo make it easy to run fund-raising campaigns with tiered rewards for donors.It’s important to note that these platforms work best when you’ve already gathered a group of people who are into what you do.The musician Amanda Palmer has had wild success turning her audience into patrons: After showing her work,sharing her music freely, 165",174

There are certainly some strings attached to crowdfunding—when people become patrons,they feel, not altogether wrongly,that they should have some say in how their money is being used.It’s partly for this reason that my business model is still pretty old-fashioned: I make something and sell it for money.Instead of having a donate now button on my website,I have buy now and hire me buttons.But even though I operate more like a traditional salesman,I do use some of the same tactics as crowdfunders: I try to be open about my process,connect with my audience,and ask them to support me by buying the things I’m selling.

He says the sabbatical has turned out to be invaluable to his work:“Everything that we designed in the seven years following the first sabbatical had its roots in thinking done during that sabbatical.” I,too,have experienced this phenomenon: I spent my first two years out of college working a nondemanding part-time job in a library,doing nothing but reading and writing and drawing.I’d say I’ve spent the years since executing a lot 191",170

Using our body relaxes our mind,and when our mind gets relaxed,it opens up to having new thoughts. Jump on the treadmill and let your mind go.If you’re like me and you hate exercise,get a dog—dogs won’t let you get away with missing a day. • Nature. Go to a park.Take a hike.Dig in your garden.

The comedian Louis C.K.worked on the same hour of material for 15 years,until he found out that his hero, George Carlin,threw out his material every year and started from scratch.C.K.was scared to try it,but once he did,it set him free.“When you’re done telling jokes about airplanes and dogs,and you throw those away,what do you have left? You can only dig deeper.You start talking about your feelings and who you are.And then you do those jokes and they’re gone.You gotta dig deeper.”When you get rid of old material,you push yourself further and come up with something better.When you throw out old work,what you’re really doing is making room for new work. 197",179

So don’t think of it as starting over.Think of it as beginning again.Go back to chapter one—literally!—and become an amateur.Look for something new to learn,and when you find it,dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open.

Page 221,"NOTES & ILLUSTRATION CREDITS 1. You don’t have to be a genius. I took the photo of Beethoven in San Francisco outside the Academy of Arts and Science in Golden Gate Park. The bust is a copy of sculptor Henry Baerer’s monument in Central Park. “Read obituaries”is also chapter 6½ in Charles Wheelan’s 10½Things No Commencement Speaker Has Ever Said (Norton,2012). 2. Think process, not product. The title of the second section comes from something Gay Talese once said in an interview:“I am a documentarian of what I do.” 212",94

The engraving is from Ferrante Imperato’s Dell’Historia Naturale di Ferrante Imperato Napolitano (1599).It’s also featured in the back of Lawrence Weschler’s Mr.Wilson’s Cabinet of Wonder (Pantheon,1995). The photo of the sign on the brick wall was taken in a back alley somewhere in Philadelphia.It has not been altered. 5. Tell good stories. I read about Dan Harmon’s thoughts on structure in the October 2011 issue of Wired,which also included an illustration of his story circle. Kurt Vonnegut drew his story shapes in several lectures,but his best explanation of the concept can be found in Palm Sunday (Delacorte,1981).He revisited the shapes later on in A Man Without a Country (Seven Stories,2005). 213",122

The “Catch & Release Only”fishing sign was photographed at Mueller Lake Park in Austin,Texas. The last photo was taken at the Dairy Queen on Manor Road in East Austin. 9. Sell out. The title of the first section is a paraphrase of a professor at Whitman College named Tommy Howells,whose students recorded him saying,“The Renaissance,like everything else,had to be financed.”Read more of his aphorisms on Twitter: @TommyHowells. 214",103
Page 224,"“Please pay me”is an erasure of a parking sign in Seattle, Washington. “My business is art”is an erasure of a parking sign in Lockhart,Texas. I spotted the church sign outside of Knox Presbyterian Church in Toronto,Ontario. 10. Stick around. “You gotta go away so you can come back”was something David Lynch’s character said on the third season of the television show Louie. 215",67
